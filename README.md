# Dark Theme

## Description

This theme was realised to convert the Matomo interface to a brand new black theme. It uses the Less variables defined in matomo and some news CSS common variables that you can change. All CSS is made with natives variables so feel free to override them to match you exact colors!

If you enjoy this theme, I will do my best to keep it updated regularly, and follow the Matomo updates to match the Dark Theme. This theme is only visual, it does not add any functionality, and does not in any way modify the HTML structure of Matomo, so there should never be any conflict with your installation of Matomo.

__Thank you for installing !__
