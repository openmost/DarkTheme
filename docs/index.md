## Documentation

This theme use LESS to override current CSS. All files and assets are in the "stylesheets" folder at the root of the theme.
To make it more readable, all differents parts are splitted in the "component" folder.

If you want to contribute, please download the folder and continue in this direction using small and maintainable components. 

Consider this is my second Matomo theme, be compliant and please tell me how to make it better if you see any errors.

### Overrided componants
- Page card style
- Dashboard widgets
- Header
- Site menu
- Search bar
- Sparkline (thank to https://lw1.at for showing the right way)
